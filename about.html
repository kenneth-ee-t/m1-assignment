                                Petone is flat. It is nestled between the Hutt River to the north and east, hills on the west and Wellington Harbour to the south. The land along the Petone foreshore was uplifted by a metre or more after the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake. This improved drainage around the mouth of the Hutt River. The foreshore at Petone has a shallow sandy beach, formed by sediment from the Hutt River, which is a popular family swimming spot. The Korokoro Stream comes down off the hills at the western side of Petone. As a low-lying suburb, Petone is vulnerable to tsunami and the threat of flooding. During a severe storm on 20 December 1976, the Korokoro Stream caused flooding almost a metre deep in the industrial area of Petone around Cornish Street, and more than 40 people had to be rescued from factory roofs.

                                Petone was the first European settlement in the Wellington region and retains many historical buildings and landmarks. The first European settlers in large numbers arrived on 22 January 1840 on the ship Aurora[16] which brought 25 married couples, 36 single persons and 40 children. The Aurora is commemorated in the Petone Settlers Museum, which has a sculpture shaped like the bow of the ship protruding from the front of the building. Maori from the nearby Pito-one pƒÅ came to meet the new arrivals, with one passenger recording in his diary: "The first great object of attraction was the venerable old chief Te Puni, his interesting and beautiful wife 'Victoria,' and his handsome daughter Aena, the princess, together with sons and endless relatives and a pa full of natives who were delighted to greet us with 'Kapai te Pakeha,' Tena-koe, and other expressions of greeting."

                            <p>One remnant of Petone's industrial history is the Petone Wharf. The original wharf was built to allow the Gear Meat Works to move its products quickly to Wellington for export.[53] That wharf was demolished and the current wharf built slightly further north along the shore in 1908-1909.[54] The wharf was popular with walkers and people fishing, but was closed to the public in January 2021 after suffering earthquake damage in the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake and two smaller subsequent earthquakes.[55][56] In May 2021 Hutt City Council voted to repair the wharf[57] but as of May 2022 was still considering the best course of action.[58] In November 2023 Hutt City Council announced that it would be demolishing the wharf.</p>
