                            <p>Petone is flat. It is nestled between the Hutt River to the north and east, hills on the west and Wellington Harbour to the south. The land along the Petone foreshore was uplifted by a metre or more after the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake. This improved drainage around the mouth of the Hutt River. The foreshore at Petone has a shallow sandy beach, formed by sediment from the Hutt River, which is a popular family swimming spot. The Korokoro Stream comes down off the hills at the western side of Petone. As a low-lying suburb, Petone is vulnerable to tsunami and the threat of flooding. During a severe storm on 20 December 1976, the Korokoro Stream caused flooding almost a metre deep in the industrial area of Petone around Cornish Street, and more than 40 people had to be rescued from factory roofs.</p>
